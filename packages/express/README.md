# Typescript

[Basketry generator](https://github.com/basketry/basketry) for generating [ExpressJS routers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). This parser can be coupled with any Basketry parser.

## Quick Start

The following example generates ExpressJS routers from a "Swagger" doc:

1. Save `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json` as `petstore.json` in the root of your project.
1. Install packages: `npm install -g basketry @basketry/swagger-2 @basketry/express @basketry/typescript @basketry/typescript-validators`
1. Generate code: `basketry --source petstore.json --parser @basketry/swagger-2 --generators @basketry/express @basketry/typescript @basketry/typescript-validators --output src`

When the last step is run, basketry will parse the source file (`petstore.json`) using the specified parser (`@basketry/swagger-2`) and then run each specified generator (`@basketry/express`, `@basketry/typescript`, and `@basketry/typescript-validators`) writing the output folder (`src`).

The routers can then be added to an Express server:

```ts
import * as express from 'express';

import {
  petRoutes,
  storeRoutes,
  userRoutes,
} from './express-routers'; // Generated by @basketry/express
import { PetService, StoreService, UserService } from './types'; // Generated by @basketry/typescript
import { DbPetService, DbStoreService, DbUserService } from './implementations'; // Your hand-written implementations of the generated service interfaces

const app = express();

app.use('/v1', [
  petRoutes(new DbPetService()),
  storeRoutes(new DbStoreService()),
  userRoutes(new DbUserService()),
]);

// TODO: add global error handlers, etc

app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log('listening on', 8000);
});

```

## For contributors:

### Run this project

1.  Install packages: `npm ci`
1.  Build the code: `npm run build`
1.  Run it! `npm start`

Note that the `lint` script is run prior to `build`. Auto-fixable linting or formatting errors may be fixed by running `npm run fix`.

### Create and run tests

1.  Add tests by creating files with the `.test.ts` suffix
1.  Run the tests: `npm t`
1.  Test coverage can be viewed at `/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Publish a new package version

1. Ensure latest code is published on the `main` branch.
1. Create the new version number with `npm version {major|minor|patch}`
1. Push the branch and the version tag: `git push origin main --follow-tags`

The [publish workflow](https://github.com/basketry/typescript/actions/workflows/publish.yml) will build and pack the new version then push the package to NPM. Note that publishing requires write access to the `main` branch.
